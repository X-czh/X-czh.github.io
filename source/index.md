I am a final-year master student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), studying Computer Science. I am interested in a wide range of topics related to infrastructure for building software systems, including distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages, and compilers. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at New York University Shanghai (NYUSH), where I majored in Computer Science, and minored in Mathematics and Data Science.

I was born and raised in Suzhou, a beautiful city in China where the ancient and the modern blend. I then had the luck to live and study in two amazing cityies: Shanghai and New York. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading, cycling and playing Dota.

I'm blessed with a lovely girlfriend who is always enthusiastic in exploring the beauty of the world and creating wonderful graphical designs, check out more [here](https://susanxx.com/).
