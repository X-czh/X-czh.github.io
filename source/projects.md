## [MapleJuice](../MapleJuice)

*Sep 2019 - Dec 2019*

A batch processing system that works like MapReduce. It is built from scratch with 4400 lines of Go and is 65% faster than Hadoop on small files (< 128MB) in a microbenchmark.

## [smart_ptr](../smart_ptr)

*Jul 2019*

My own implementation of C++ smart pointers. It implements roughly the entire smart pointers part (ยง20.7) of ISO C++ 2011.

## [SeqGAN-PyTorch](../SeqGAN-PyTorch)

*Jul 2018*

An implementation of [SeqGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05473.pdf) in PyTorch.

## [Java2Cpp-Translator](../Java2Cpp-Translator)

*Sep 2017 - Dec 2017*

A translator from a restricted version of Java to C++. It is primarily interested in modeling basic translation and support key features of OOP like dynamic dispatch and method overloading. It does not make use of C++'s inheritance to mimic compiler's implementation of inheretance.
